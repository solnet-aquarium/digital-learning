# Formatting
Code in a project should look as if one developer wrote it. 

*Nobody wants to read a book written with 4 different writing styles, nor does anyone want to read code written in the same way.*

## Therefore:

 - Use **either** the tool the lead developer has decreed shall be used on the project to format code
 - Use [JS Beautify][js_beautify] to ensure all JS code is similarly formatted. Many editor plugins exist for JS Beautify. Find the one for your editor and install it. 

## Notes

 - There is **no excuse** for sloppy code formatting. Crafting and submitting quality code should be a matter of pride for all team members.
